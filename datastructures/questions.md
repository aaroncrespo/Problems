1. Insert an element into a sorted doubly linked list, so that the list
remains sorted
1. Implement a hash table
1. Implement a queue by using two stacks which are in turn implemented by
linked lists.
1. Given a list, split the list into its front half, and back half. Handle all corner cases.
1. Test if a binary tree is a binary search tree
1. Create a balanced binary search tree from a doubly linked list of n integers
1. Write a non-recursive function to delete an entire binary tree. Solve
in two different ways.
1. Implement the reversal of a singly linked list iteratively and recursively.
1. Given a binary tree return its preorder traversal as a doubly linked list
1. Given a binary tree return its inorder traversal as a doubly linked list
1. Given a binary tree return its postorder traversal as a doubly linked list
1. Given a sorted singly linked list, create a balanced binary search tree
1. Given a linked list of integers and an integer value, delete every
node of the linked list containing that value.
1. Convert a binary search tree into a sorted circular doubly-linked
list. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the
previous and next pointers in the doubly-linked list.
1. Improve the greedy solution to TSP
